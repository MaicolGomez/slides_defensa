Most of the consumers are analyzing the appropriateness of cloud to employ themselves for their enterprise or personalized operations. Customers are self-satisfied at the inception, but expectation changes. Based on their business escalation it needs further adoption of modern cloud services the existing cloud provider fails to offer. Hence the user needs interoperability and portability to ship their assets from one cloud to other cloud. The complication faced by the customers in shifting their assets remains as a challenge to be addressed. In this paper we outline the existing cloud technologies, interoperability issues and possible solution to overcome the problems. "

ABSTRACT={Handoff mechanisms allow mobile users travel through wireless access points
while maintaining their voice and/or data sessions active. Traditional
handoff process is concerned with smoothly transferring a mobile device
session from its current access point (or cell) to a target access point
(or cell). These handoff characteristics are sufficient for voice calls and
background data transfers, however nowadays many mobile applications are
heavily based on data and processing capabilities from the cloud. Such
applications, specially the more interactive ones, often demand not only a
smooth session transfer, but also the maintenance of quality of service
requirements that impact users experience. In this context, the Fog
Computing paradigm arises to overcome delays encountered when applications
need low latency to access data or offload processing to the cloud. Fog
computing introduces a distributed cloud layer, composed of cloudlets
(i.e., {"}small clouds{"} with lower computational capacity), between the
user and the cloud. Cloudlets allow low latency access to data or
processing capabilities, which can be accomplished by offering a VM to the
user. In this paper we present a general architecture to support virtual
machine migration in the Fog, discussing migration benefits and
challenges.
